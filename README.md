# MPC-Trajectory-Tracking
This project is part of my 2024 Thesis. It focuses on using MPC and LQR controllers to help an autonomous car track a desired trajectory. 
The project consists of two workspaces: "GUI_ws," which runs the GUI on my laptop, and another workspace that runs the controller on a Jetson Nano. Communication between the two devices is handled by ROS (Version: Noetic).
